# E14Z - AI Tool Discovery Platform

The npm for AI agents. Discover, evaluate, and connect to MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.

## üöÄ Vision

E14Z is the missing discovery layer between AI models and the thousands of MCP servers being created. Think of it as "npm for AI agents" - a platform that helps AI agents and developers find, evaluate, and connect to the right tools for any task.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Intelligent Search**: Multi-factor ranking system considering relevance, performance, and health
- **Real-time Health Monitoring**: Live status indicators for all MCP servers
- **Performance Analytics**: Latency, success rates, and usage metrics
- **Agent-Optimized**: Built specifically for AI agent consumption
- **REST & MCP APIs**: Multiple integration methods for maximum compatibility
- **Community Reviews**: Performance feedback from real agent usage

## üîß Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Search**: Full-text search with trigram similarity
- **Deployment**: Vercel with Edge Functions
- **Monitoring**: Real-time health checks and performance tracking

## üèóÔ∏è Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aemholland/e14z.git
   cd e14z
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Fill in your Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
   ```

4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üì° API Usage

### REST API

Search for MCP servers:
```bash
curl "https://e14z.com/api/discover?q=invoice+processing"
```

### MCP Protocol

Connect via MCP protocol:
```bash
mcp connect https://e14z.com/mcp
```

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

The database is designed for scale and intelligence:

- **mcps**: Core MCP registry with flexible schema
- **performance_logs**: Time-series performance data
- **reviews**: Agent feedback with context
- **health_checks**: Real-time monitoring data
- **api_calls**: Discovery analytics
- **tool_chains**: Common MCP combinations

## üìä Open Source Model

E14Z follows the "open source code, proprietary data" model:

- **Open Source**: All application code, APIs, and infrastructure
- **Proprietary**: The curated MCP database and performance analytics

This approach builds developer trust while maintaining our competitive advantage through data quality and network effects.
